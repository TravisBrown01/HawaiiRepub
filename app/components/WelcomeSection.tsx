      <div className="welcome-body">
        <p>Aloha and welcome. We are proud to stand on the enduring principles that shaped our great nation—principles rooted in faith, individual liberty, and the conviction that government exists to serve the people, not to rule over them.</p>
        <p>As the Hawai‘i Republican Party, we champion the foundational truths enshrined in our Constitutional Republic. We affirm that the rights of life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness are not granted by the state, but by God—and it is our duty to protect and preserve those unalienable rights for every citizen.</p>
        <p>Guided by the wisdom of our Founders and inspired by the meaning behind Hawai‘i's motto, <em>Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono</em>—"The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness"—we commit ourselves to upholding the integrity of our people, our culture, and our future.</p>
        <p>Whether you are a lifelong advocate or just beginning your journey with us, we welcome you to stand for freedom, for family, and for the values that have shaped generations. Together, let us work to preserve the quality of life we cherish—and to ensure Hawai'i continues to thrive in righteousness and liberty.</p>
