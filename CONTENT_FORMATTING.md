# Content Formatting Guide

When adding content to event details, you can use the following formatting options:

## Line Breaks and Paragraphs

- **Single line break**: Use one line break for spacing within a paragraph
- **Double line break**: Use two line breaks to create a new paragraph

Example:
```
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph with a line break
within it.
```

## Bold Text

Use double asterisks or double underscores around text to make it bold:

- `**Bold text**` or `__Bold text__` â†’ **Bold text**

Example:
```
Welcome to our **special event**!

This event will feature:
- **Keynote Speaker**: John Doe
- **Panel Discussion**: __Important topics__ will be covered
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use double line breaks** between major sections
2. **Use single line breaks** for lists or spacing within sections
3. **Use bold formatting** for important information like names, times, or key points
4. **Keep paragraphs concise** for better readability
